This page is just as an explanation to create small gifs from images (viewpoints, disparity or so) in order to show what can be done with the images.



the script gen_gif is a shell script to generate a gif from the views generated from the perspective_views.py script, for example

it should be run as 

`sh gen_gif ~/complete_path_to_the_root_folder_where_you_will_find_the_Views_folder(without_Views_in_the_path)`

It should output information about what is trying to do.
