# Animation

This page is just as an explanation to create small gifs from images (viewpoints, disparity or so) in order to show what can be done with the images.

Here a downscaled version of a gif created with the script `gen_gif`

the script `gen_gif` is a shell script to generate a gif from the views generated from the perspective_views.py script, for example

it should be run as 

`sh gen_gif ~/complete_path_to_the_root_folder_where_you_will_find_the_Views_folder(without_Views_in_the_path)`

It should output information about what is trying to do.
